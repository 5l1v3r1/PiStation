About the Program and What it Does

The PiStation allows you to use the code (from icrobotics link below) in a more simple way, simply load your music
onto your Pi, and play!

I apreciate all the help, and encourage updates to this program!  I still have a lot to learn, so any help would be awesome!

Have fun with your Pi!
